# Kaggle Data Science Projects

This repository contains my data science and machine learning projects based on various Kaggle competitions and popular datasets.

This repository features **20 projects**. These projects cover various stages of the data science pipeline, from data cleaning and modeling to creating live demos for some of them.

Some of my work has been deployed as interactive demos on the **Hugging Face Spaces** platform.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

These projects primarily use the following technologies and libraries:

* **Programming Language:** `Python`
* **Environment:** `Jupyter Notebook`
* **Data Analysis & Manipulation:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`
* **Machine Learning:** `Scikit-learn`
* **Deployment (Live Demo):** `Hugging Face Spaces`, `Streamlit`
* **Data Visualization:** `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

## üìÇ How to Use

You can find all the projects in their respective folders within this repository. Each folder typically contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file.

You can access the interactive demos deployed on Hugging Face Spaces via [my Hugging Face profile](https://huggingface.co/kadirg7).
